## PCA 

correlation, maximizing variance/minimzies information loss

## ICA 

maximally independence, separates components
typically used for separating superimposed signals (independent signals?)

sum independent variables -> normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem)

x_j = a_j1 * s_1 + a_j2 * s_2 + ... + a_jn * s_n

x_j -> mixture
s_j = component

Both are assumed to have a 0 mean

## RCA

generates random directions
